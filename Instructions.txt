- It has been an extremely busy month at work, and I didn't get to 
  implement much of what I had intended, which resulted in this not being my best work.
  It was fun, however, and I wish I had taken this as a 16 week course instead of 8.
  I'm not sure that I will pursue C++ much farther 1) because I really don't have a work use case
  and 2) I think I might pursue learning Rust rather than putting more time into C/C++.
  Lastly, this course made me realize how much I take for granted when using Python. ☺️

- Compiled using g++ on Linux Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
- Used the following C++ CSV library, but the required "csv.h" header file is in the "~/include"
  directory, and I don't think you have to load it again.
  https://github.com/ben-strasser/fast-cpp-csv-parser
- Compile command:
    g++ -o bin/run.exe src/Main.cpp src/Device.cpp src/Thermostat.cpp src/TV.cpp src/Lights.cpp src/SecuritySystem.cpp  -lpthread
- Execute the program with "./bin/run.exe".
- Program uses a CLI menu interface.
  I attempted to make the menu intuitive.
- Selection 1 powers on the system and registers the smart devices from CSV file ~/data/csv01.csv.
- Selection 2 operates the thermostat.
- Selection 3 operates the TV.
- Selection 4 operates the Lighting.
- Selection 5 initializes the security system and asks if you want to arm or disarm the system.
    - The security system code is "123456".
- Selection 6 exits the system.
- I did some user input verification for the menu, but I didn't have time to implement it
  everywhere user input is asked for.

*******************
**   FIXED BUG   **
*******************
  * I was having a problem getting the relative file path to work with the "fast-cpp-csv-parser".
    I believe I have fixed it.
  * The fix works on my development VM.
  * If the relative path fix does not work, instructor may need to modify the file path in the code.
    1) UserCLIMenu.cpp
       Approx. line 190, "device.displayDeviceInfo();" will need to be updated with new file path.
    2) UserCLIMenu.cpp
       Approx. line 261, "mySecuritySystem.securityInit();" will need to be updated with new file path.
