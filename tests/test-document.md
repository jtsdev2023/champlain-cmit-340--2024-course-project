## Test Cases

This program relies heavily on user CLI input. As such, all of my testing focused on providing valid and invalid data types for user input to determine the result. As you would expect, mismatched data types were problematic for the C++ program. I implemented some verification of user input. I would have done more if I had more time. The exception handling I implemented ("try... catch", input verification, and loop mitigation in flow control) relatively gracefully handles a good portion of the errors I generated.
